# üéµ Audio Features Integration

## Overview

The MentraOS Nutrition Lens now includes **text-to-speech audio generation** using ElevenLabs and UploadThing. Claude's dietary analysis responses are automatically converted to audio and uploaded to your UploadThing bucket for easy access.

## ‚ú® What's New

### 1. **Automatic Audio Generation**
- Claude's dietary analysis text is automatically converted to speech using ElevenLabs
- Audio files are uploaded to UploadThing and accessible via URL
- High-quality MP3 audio with customizable voices

### 2. **Enhanced Workflow**
```
User asks dietary question ‚Üí Photo captured ‚Üí Claude analyzes ‚Üí 
ElevenLabs generates audio ‚Üí UploadThing stores audio ‚Üí 
Returns both text analysis + audio URL
```

### 3. **New API Endpoints**
- `/api/audio/text-to-speech` - Convert any text to audio
- `/api/audio/dietary-analysis` - Full dietary analysis with audio

===============================================
```

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Features

### Simplified Database Approach
- **No more complex JSON parsing** - entire users table sent to Claude
- **Claude handles user lookup** and dietary restriction parsing
- **Robust error handling** for missing users or database issues

### UploadThing Storage
- Audio files stored in `nutrilens-audio` bucket
- Organized with custom IDs: `tts-{userId}-{timestamp}`
- Automatic cleanup and management via UploadThing

### ElevenLabs Configuration
- Uses `eleven_multilingual_v2` model for best quality
- MP3 format at 44.1kHz/128kbps for optimal file size
- Configurable voice selection per request

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

### Environment Variables Required
```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your_uploadthing_secret
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your_uploadthing_app_id
```

### Testing the Integration
1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test basic text-to-speech:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/audio/text-to-speech \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Hello world", "userId": "test"}'
   ```

3. **Test via glasses:** Ask a dietary question using your smart glasses

## üìà Performance Notes

- **Audio Generation Time:** ~2-5 seconds for typical responses
- **File Sizes:** ~50-200KB for typical dietary analysis responses  
- **Storage:** Files permanently stored in UploadThing (consider cleanup policies)
- **Rate Limits:** Subject to ElevenLabs API rate limits

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Voice cloning** for personalized user voices
- **Batch audio generation** for multiple analyses
- **Audio caching** to avoid regenerating identical responses
- **Streaming audio** for real-time playback on glasses
- **Multiple language support** via ElevenLabs multilingual models
